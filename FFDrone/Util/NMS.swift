/**
  Removes bounding boxes that overlap too much with other boxes that have

  Based on code from https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/core/kernels/non_max_suppression_op.cc
  - Note: This version of NMS ignores the class of the bounding boxes. Since it
    selects the bounding boxes in a greedy fashion, if a certain class has many
    boxes that are selected, then it is possible none of the boxes of the other
    classes get selected.
  - Parameters:
    - boundingBoxes: an array of bounding boxes and their scores
    - indices: which predictions to look at
    - iouThreshold: used to decide whether boxes overlap too much
    - maxBoxes: the maximum number of boxes that will be selected
  - Returns: the array indices of the selected bounding boxes
